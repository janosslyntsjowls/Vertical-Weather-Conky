Weather Icons

Weather Icons are available from Weather Underground here:

I downloaded mine from Flat Icon (https://www.flaticon.com) and renamed them. The icons must not have spaces in their names, for some reason Conky does not handle that well.

I placed my icons in $HOME/Pictures/Icons/WeatherIcons

The icons you need immediately are in the WeatherIcons folder. If you update your own icons, use the names listed under "Forecast Description Phrases", the first column, without spaces:
